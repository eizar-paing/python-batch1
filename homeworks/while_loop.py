# 1.   Repeatedly ask the user for their username and password until they enter the correct credentials (correct username and correct password).
# 2.   We want user to input any number between 100 and 500. Keep asking the user to enter a correct input until he/she enters the correct number within a given range.
#  3.   Write a while loop to display each character from a string and if a character is number then stop the loop.
#  4.   Print even and odd number between 1 to the number that user entered.Â 
# Eg. print(n, 'is a even number') or print(n, 'is a even number')
#  5.   Check how many times a given number can be divided by 3 before it is less than or equal to 10.
